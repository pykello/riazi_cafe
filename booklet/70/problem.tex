\begin{problem}{70/figs/70_pic.jpg}{Parking} We have 10 parking spaces lined up from left to right. We also have 10 drivers, each with a favourite parking space (possibly multiple drivers for the same space). Drivers enter from the left in order. If a driver's favourite parking space is available, they park there. Otherwise, they park in the first empty space to the right of their favourite spot. If they can't find a spot using this method, they leave.\\[0.2cm]
	
How many arrangements are there for favourite parking spaces that allow all drivers to park? (An arrangement is a sequence of 10 numbers $a_1$ to $a_{10}$, where $a_i$ is the favourite parking space of the driver who enters i-th.)
\end{problem}
