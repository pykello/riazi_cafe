\begin{problem}{4/figs/04_coins.jpg}{Finding the Fake Coins}We have 12 coins, one of which is fake, and we want to find the fake coin using a scale with two sides. How many times do we need to use the scale to find the fake coin? Note that, the weights of the 11 real coins are equal, and the weight of the fake coin is different from the rest (can be lower or higher). Each time we use the scale, we can put two disjoint subsets of the coins on its two sides and compare their weights.\\[0.2cm]
