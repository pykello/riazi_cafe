\begin{problem}{56/figs/pic.jpg}{Red Card}  Two players are playing a game. The first player shuffles 52 cards (26 red cards and 26 black cards) and turns them over one by one. At each stage, before the card is turned over, the second player can say "stop". In this case, the game ends and if the color of the next card that will be turned over is red, the second player wins; Otherwise, he loses. Also, If the second player doesn't say stop before the last card is turned over, he loses. What is the best strategy for the second player to maximize his chances of winning?\\[0.2cm]
