\begin{problem}{39/figs/pic.jpg}{Table of Numbers}We have a $5 \times 7$ table and we wish to put $1$ or $-1$ in each of its cells, so that the product of the numbers of each row becomes $-1$ and the product of the numbers of each column becomes $-1$ (similar to the figure below). How many different ways can we do that?\\[0.2cm]

\textbf{Additional problem}: What if the table is $15 \times 16$?
