\begin{problem}{77/figs/77_pic.jpg}{Sorting the Cards} We have a billion cards, each with a unique number from 1 to $10^9$, placed in a random order. We can see the number on every card. For one dollar, we can perform the following operation: divide the cards into any number of stacks, reverse each stack, and then stack the reversed stacks on top of each other in their order. What is the minimum cost to sort the cards into ascending order, considering the worst-case scenario?\\[0.2cm]
	
\textbf{Example}: Consider 5 cards in the following order $[4,3,5,1,2]$. By spending 1 dollar, we could divide them into 3 stacks: $[4,3]$, $[5]$, and $[1,2]$. Reversing each stack gives us $[3,4]$, $[5]$, and $[2, 1]$. Stacking these together gives us  $[3,4,5,2,1]$.
