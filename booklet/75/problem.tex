\begin{problem}{75/figs/75_pic.jpg}{Ice Cream Sharing} We want to divide an ice cream between two people. Each time, we flip a coin and choose one of the two people. We ask them if they would accept $10\%$ of the ice cream and give $90\%$ to the other person. If they accept, the process is finished and the ice cream is divided. Otherwise, $10\%$ of the ice cream melts (meaning its volume is multiplied by $90\%$) and the process is repeated. If the players play optimally, how much ice cream does each player receive on average?\\[0.2cm]
	
Note that each player plays in a way that maximizes his own share of the ice cream given that the other player plays strategically.
