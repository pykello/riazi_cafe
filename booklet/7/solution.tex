\begin{solution}.
The answer is equal to 45.\\[0.2cm]

For every two people, there should be a special lock for them whose key is not given to them and that all other eight people have the key to that lock. Therefore at least $\binom{10}{2} = 45$ locks are needed. On the other hand, if we put a lock on the door for every two people and give its key to the other eight people, both conditions of the question will be satisfied. \\[0.2cm]
