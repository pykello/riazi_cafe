\begin{problem}{31/figs/31_roshanak.png}{Lights} The school wherein Roshank studies has 10 lamps at the highest point of the ceiling. Each of these lamps is controlled by a separate key in the control room in the basement. There are 10 keys in the control room but Roshanak doesn't know which key controls which light.\\[0.2cm]

Roshank is very tired and does not want to go to the control room more than 3 times. How many key-light pairs can she figure out with going to the basement three times? Each time she goes to the control room, she can turn some of the keys on and off and then come back and see which lights are on. All the lights are off in the beginning.\\[0.2cm]
