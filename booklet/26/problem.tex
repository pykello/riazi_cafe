\begin{problem}{26/figs/26_oppenheimer.jpg}{Oppenheimer ticket queue}
40 people are standing in a line in front of a cinema to buy tickets to the Oppenheimer movie. The ticket price is 5 dollars. Out of these 40 people, 25 of them have only 5 dollar bills and 15 of them have only 10 dollar bills. The cashier has no cash in the beginning, however, when people start purchasing tickets she will collect cash based on what they give her. Indeed, the price of the ticket is 5 dollars and if a person gives a 10 dollar bill to the cashier, she has to return a 5 dollar bill. How many different permutations of people will allow the cashier to always give a 5 dollar bill to the people who only have 10 dollar bills?\\[0.2cm]
