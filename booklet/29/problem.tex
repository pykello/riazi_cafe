\begin{problem}{29/figs/29_archimedes.png}{Birth of Archimedes}
	Nick and Nikoo know that Archimedes' birthday is one of the following 10 dates, but they forgot which one it is (Khordad, Shahrivar, Azar, and Dey are names of months in Persian calendar):

\begin{itemize}
\item  Khordad 4, Khordad 5, Khordad 8,
\item  Shahrivar 4, Shahrivar 7, 
\item Azar 1, Azar 5,
\item  Dey 1, Dey 2, Dey 8
\end{itemize}

The soul of Archimedes comes back to life and whispers the month of his birthday in Nick's ears and day of his birthday in Nikoo's ear. After this, Nick says: 
\begin{center}
``I don't know Archimedes' birthday, but neither does Nikoo."
\end{center}

After hearing what Nick said, Nikoo responded:

\begin{center}
	``I didn't know when his birthday was previously, but now I know."
\end{center}

Then Nick says:

\begin{center}
	``Now I know too."
\end{center}

When is Archimedes' birthday?\\[0.2cm]
