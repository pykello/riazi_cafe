\begin{solution}.
The answer is equal to: $2 \ln 2 - 1$.\\[0.2cm]

In the first division, the size of the larger part will be equal to $1/2 + x$, where the value of $x$ is drawn randomly from the interval $[0,1/2]$. According to the triangle inequality, it is possible to make a triangle with the broken pieces if the size of the larger part of the second division is less than $1/2$. The probability of this happening is equal to $(1/2 - x)/(1/2+x)$. So the answer to the question is equal to the following integral:
$$\int_{0}^{\frac{1}{2}} x \frac{\frac{1}{2} - x}{\frac{1}{2} + x} d_x  = 2\ln 2-1 \simeq 0.38629436112.$$
