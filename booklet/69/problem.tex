\begin{problem}{69/figs/69_pic.jpg}{Aziz and Basketball} Aziz is practicing basketball free throws. His first shot goes in, and his second shot misses. From then on, the probability of his $(n+1)$'th shot going in is proportional to his performance in the previous $n$ shots (i.e., if 2 out of the first 5 shots go in, the 6th shot has a 2/5 chance of going in).\\[0.2cm]
	
What is the probability that Aziz will make exactly 25 successful shots out of 50 shots?
\end{problem}
