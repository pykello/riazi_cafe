\begin{problem}{53/figs/53_heshmat.png}{Heshmat and Elevators}  The office building of Hashmat has 15 floors and two elevators. Hashmat wants to get on the elevator on the 13th floor. What is the probability that the first elevator that reaches this floor will go down?\\[0.2cm]
	
Explanations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Elevators only change directions when they reach floors 0 or 15.
	\item The time spent on stopping the elevator and picking up people is assumed to be negligible compared to the time spent moving.
	\item Each elevator starts moving from a random location in the continuous real line between floors 0 and 15, with a random direction, independently of each other at the beginning of the day. The speeds of the elevators are equal.
\end{itemize}
