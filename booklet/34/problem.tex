\begin{problem}{34/figs/34_stock.png}{IPO}You are going to participate in the purchase of the initial shares of a company. We know that the stock value of the company is a random variable drawn from the uniform distribution $[0,1000]$. Although you are not aware of the value at the IPO, you do have the knowledge of the distribution. You offer a bid $x$ to the owner of the company. If the value of the company's shares at the IPO is less than $x$, you would buy that company's shares at a value of $x$ dollars, otherwise you wouldn't buy anything.

You know that the value of the company's stock will increase by $50$ percent after your purchase. What proposal would you make to the owner of the company?\\[0.2cm]
