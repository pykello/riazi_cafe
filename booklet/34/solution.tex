\begin{solution}
Your best move is to propose a bid of $0$ to the owner (which does not load to a purchase).\\[0.2cm]
	
Suppose you offer a bid of $x$ to buy the company's share. Then the probability that you will buy the stock is $x/1000$ (probability that the stock value is  less than $x$). Also, in this case, the average share value is equal to $x/2$, which after a $50\%$ increase will be equal to $0.75x$, which is still less than the amount of money paid. Thus, the it is best if you make a bid of $x=0$.
