\begin{problem}{17/figs/17_dragon.jpg}{Shoot the Dragon}We have 100 boxes that are arranged horizontally in a line. A dragon is in one of these boxes, however, the box is unknown to us. Moreover, we have a gun and we can use the gun to shoot the boxes and if the dragon is in the box we shoot at, he will die. If the dragon survives a shot, he jumps to either the right box or the left box (if they exist). Is there an algorithm to shoot the boxes one by one that will surely kill the dragon? If not, why? If yes, what is the algorithm?\\[0.2cm]

\textbf{clarification:} The shooting can go on as long as we wish to continue. Each time, we shoot first and if the dragon survives, he makes a move to either the left box or the right box. Keep in mind that dragons are super smart and if there is a way for them to escape the shooting, they will do so.\\[0.2cm]
