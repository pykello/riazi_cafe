\begin{problem}{10/figs/10_hats.jpg}{Hats}Three people enter a room and someone randomly puts red or blue hats on each of them. Everyone sees the color of the hats of the other two people, but does not see the color of his own hat.

Each person either makes a guess on the color of his own hat and writes the color down on a piece of paper or leaves the paper blank. All the papers then are given to a judge. If at least one of the guesses is correct and none of them is wrong, they will win a  prize. What strategy guarantees the highest probability of winning? How likely is chance of winning with that strategy?\\[0.2cm]

\textbf{More details}:
\begin{itemize}
\item They can agree on a strategy before they enter the room, but no information should be exchanged between them inside the room.
\item Each of the 8 combinations of hat colors will realize with probability $1/8$.
\end{itemize}
