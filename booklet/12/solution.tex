\begin{solution}.
The correct answer is 21.\\[0.2cm]

Let us assume that the total size of the cake is 1. The cake can be cut into the following pieces:
\begin{itemize}
\item 9 pieces of size $1/15$.
\item 6 pieces of size $2/45$.
\item 6 pieces of size $1/45$.
\end{itemize}

If 15 guests show up to the party, Taghi can give 9 guests pieces of size  1/15 and give 6 guests two pieces of sizes $1/45$ and $2/45$.\\
If 9 guests show up to the party, Taghi can give 6 guests two pieces of sizes  $1/15$ and $2/45$ and give 3 guests three pieces of sizes $1/15$, $1/45$, and $1/45$.
