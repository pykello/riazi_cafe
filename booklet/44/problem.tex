\begin{problem}{44/figs/01_gashniz.jpg}{The Magician}A magician has 52 cards (13 heart cards, 13 club cards, 13 diamond cards and 13 spades cards) and plays a game with Dena and Tara. In this game, there is a number $n$ and a number $k$, which the magician, Dena and Tara are aware of before the game starts.

Dena and Tara are teammates and their goal is to defeat the magician together.
Before the game start, Dena and Tara fix a strategy for the game. When the game starts, the magician gives Dena $n \leq 52$ cards, then Dena chooses $k < n$ cards and shows them to Tara in the order of his choosing. After observing those cards and their order, Tara has to tell Dena what are the other $n-k$ cards in his hand. If Tara can identify them correctly, Dena and Tara win the game, otherwise the magician wins.

\textbf{first question}: show that for $n=5$ and $k=4$, Dena and Tara can win the game.

\textbf{challenge question}: for what pairs of $n$ and $k$ can Dena and Tara win the game?\\[0.2cm]
