\begin{problem}{49/figs/pic.jpg}{Josephus Problem}  1234 people are standing in a circle and are numbered in the clockwise order from 1 to 1234. Starting from person number 1, each time we skip one person and eliminate the next person. We repeat this process until only one person remains in the circle. Who will be the last person?\\[0.2cm]
	
What if instead of 1234, we have 12345678987654321 people around the circle?\\[0.2cm]
	
\textbf{Explanation}: In the version with 1234 people, first person number 2 is eliminated then person number 4 and so on. This goes on until person 1234 is eliminated. After going around the circle once, we again skip person 1, but since we previously eliminated person number 2, this time we eliminate person number 3. We continue this process until only one person remains.
