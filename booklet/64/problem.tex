\begin{problem}{64/figs/64_pic.jpg}{Half Cookies} There are 15 cookies in a container. Each day, we randomly pick one of the contents of this container. If it is a whole cookie, we eat half of it and put the other half back in the container. If it is a half-eaten cookie, we eat it.
	
What is the expected number of half-eaten cookies  in the container when we take out the last whole cookie?
