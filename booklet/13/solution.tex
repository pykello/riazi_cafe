Assume that the first and last person exchange their seat numbers. In this case, if the last person was sitting on his own seat in the previous case, he will not sit on his own seat now and vice versa. Therefore the number of cases in which the last person sits on his own seat is equal to the number of cases wherein the last person does not sit on his own seat.\\[0.2cm]
