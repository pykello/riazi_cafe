\begin{problem}[][Airplane seats]143 people are in line to board the plane. Each person has a different seat number between 1 and 143. The number of seats in the plane is exactly 143. The first person loses his number and sits on a random seat. From then on, everyone sits on their own seat unless someone else is sitting there, in which case they sit on a random empty seat.

What is the probability that the 143rd person will sit in his seat?
