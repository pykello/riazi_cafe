\begin{problem}{13/figs/pic.jpg}{Airplane Seats}143 people are in line to board a plane. Each person has a different seat number between 1 and 143. The number of seats in the plane is exactly 143. The first person loses his ticket and sits on a random seat. From then on, everyone sits on their own seat unless someone else is already sitting there, in which case they sit on a random empty seat. What is the probability that the 143rd person  sits on his own seat?\\[0.2cm]
