\begin{solution}.
The minimum probability is when one bag has only one black pebble and the rest of the pebbles are in the other bag. In this case the probability of choosing a white pebble is $50/198 \simeq 0.2525$.

The maximum probability is when one of the bags has one white pebble and the rest of the pebbles are in the other bag.  In this case the probability of choosing a white pebble is $1/2 + 49/198 \simeq 0.7474$.\\[0.2cm]
