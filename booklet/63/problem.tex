\begin{problem}{63/figs/63_pic.png}{0-1 Table} We have a $5 \times 5$ table which is initially filled with 0s. Each time, we can choose either a $2 \times 2$ or a $3 \times 3$ subtable and toggle all of its numbers (replace 0 by 1 and replace 1 by 0). Can we generate all $2^{25}$ different tables with a sequence of such moves? If we can, how? otherwise, why?
