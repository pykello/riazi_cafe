\begin{problem}{62/figs/62_pic.jpg}{Antenna Placement} We have a square city with whose length is 1km. We want to install 3 cellular antennas in this city.
	Each mobile phone in the city connects to the nearest antenna. The worst point in the city is the one with the weakest signal, i.e. the maximum distance from the antenna it is connected to.
	How should we choose the location of the 3 antennas to have the best signal in the worst point?
	In other words, if the answer is $x$, the distance of all points in the square from the nearest antenna should be less than or equal to x. We want to choose the location of the antennas such that $x$ is minimized.\\[0.2cm]
	Assume that each antenna is a point.
