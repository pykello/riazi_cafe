\begin{problem}{46/figs/46_search_engines.jpg}{Competition Between Bing and Google}Google and Bing are competing against each other over the search result of query  ``Math Cafe". There are three relevant results for this search. The percentage of users looking for the results are equal to 30\%, 30\%, and 40\%, respectively. Upon querying ``Math Cafe" in each of the search engines, they show a permutation of the three webpages.
	
Every time a user searches for query ``Math Cafe" in both search engines and finds out which search engine shows the result he is looking for first. Based on this he will stick to that search engine for the rest of his life. (If both search engines show the corresponding result in the same position, the user will never again use Bing or Google in his life)
	
Each search engine wishes to design an algorithm for showing the results in a way that maximizes the number of its own users minus the number of its competitor's users. What is the best strategy in this game?\\[0.2cm]
