\begin{problem}{74/figs/74_pic.jpg}{Coins} You have 20 coins in front of you, half of which are heads and half are tails. You can flip any coin you want without seeing whether it is currently heads or tails. The goal is to divide the coins into two groups so that the number of heads in the two groups are the same. Can you do this?\\[0.2cm]
	
What about the case that there are 21 coins and 5 of them are heads initially?
