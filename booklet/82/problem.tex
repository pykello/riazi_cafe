\begin{problem}{82/figs/82_pic.jpeg}{Game of Pebbles} We have a $1 \times 20$ grid. Two players play the pebble game on this grid in alternative turns. Each time, a player places a pebble on one of the empty cells, provided that the cell itself and its adjacent cells (if exist) are also empty. The person who places the last pebble wins the game.
	
If both players play optimally, who will win?
\end{problem}
