\begin{problem}{66/figs/66_pic.jpg}{Playing with Two Bowl of Cherries} Heshmat and Gholi play a two-player game. First, Heshmat puts 1369 cherries in a bowl. Then, Gholi puts a number of cherries in another bowl. From then on, Heshmat and Gholi play in turns as follows:
	
	Starting with Heshmat, they alternatively take one of the following actions:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Eat a non-zero number of cherries from the first bowl.
	\item Eat a non-zero number of cherries from the second bowl.
	\item Eat an equal non-zero number of cherries from both bowls.
	\end{itemize}
	The player who eats the last cherry wins the game. How many cherries should Gholi put in the second bowl to win the game? (Assuming both players play optimally from then on)
\end{problem}
