\begin{problem}{20/figs/20_marbles.jpg}{Bag of Pebbles}You take part in a game wherein there is a bag with 1000 black pebbles and 1000 white pebbles. Each time, you can randomly pick a pebble from the bag and remove it. If the removed pebble is black, you will receive one dollar and if it is white, you will be fined one dollar. You can continue the game as long as there is at least one pebble in the bag and stop the game at any point you wish. How would you play in this game and what is your expected reward? (The optimal strategy requires a lot of complex calculations which cannot be done without a computer. The goal of the question is to find a strategy that is simple and almost optimal.)\\[0.2cm]
