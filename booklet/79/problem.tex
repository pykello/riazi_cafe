\begin{problem}{79/figs/79_pic.jpg}{Rain} On a spring day in a northern city, it rained from 12 noon to 7 PM. Naturally, it might not have rained continuously during this entire period. Several neighbors, each for a duration of 1 hour within this 7-hour window, placed a cylindrical basin outside to collect rainwater. They observed that in no case did more than 10 millimeters of water collect in the basin during that hour. Given that at any moment during these 7 hours, at least one basin was out in the rain, what is the maximum amount of rainfall during this period?
