\begin{problem}{23/figs/23_halterthite.jpg}{Dividing the Gold Coins}
Halter Hight and four of his friend wish to divide 100 gold coins among themselves (5 people).

Each time they do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The oldest person decides how many coins should be given to whom.
\item Everyone (including the oldest person) votes to accept the division or reject it.
\item If at least half of the votes are positive, the division will be accordingly, otherwise, they will kill the oldest person and repeat the process.
\end{itemize}
Assuming that everyone decides optimally, how many coins does each person receive?\\[0.2cm]

Everyone's priorities are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item To survive (highest priority)
\item To receive more money (second priority)
\item If the above 2 are equal, make a decision that kills the most people.
\end{itemize}
