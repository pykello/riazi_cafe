\begin{solution}
Let the people involved in this process be numbered from 1 to 5 from the youngest to the oldest. The correct answer is the following: The fifth person (the oldest) takes 98 coins for himself, and gives one coin to each of the first and third persons.\\[0.2cm]

The solution is based on a bottom up analysis:
\begin{itemize}
\item If there are 2 people left, one vote is enough for the second person to survive. This would be his own vote. So the oldest person can take all 100 coins for himself.
\item If there are 3 people left, the oldest person needs 2 votes to survive. The first person also knows that in the case of 2 people, nothing will be given to him; Thus he would be happy with receiving only one coin. Therefore, the third person takes 99 coins for himself and gives one coin to the first person.
\item If there are 4 people left, with the same reasoning, the second person will be happy with receiving one coin, and thus the fourth person will get 99 coins for himself.
He takes, one for the second person, and the first and third person will receive nothing.
\item For 5 people, the first and the third persons know that if the fifth person dies, they will receive nothing. Thus, they are happy with receiving a single coin. Therefore, the fifth person takes 98 coins for himself, and gives one to each of the first and third persons.
\end{itemize}
