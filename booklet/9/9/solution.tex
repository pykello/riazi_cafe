\begin{solution}
As many friends mentioned, the ratio of girls to boys remains equal.

With this strategy, the number of girls in each family will be exactly 1. The number of boys is equal to:

* Zero with a probability of 1/2
* One with a probability of 1/4
* Two with a probability of 1/8
*...

If we set this value equal to p, it can be shown:

\\[2 \times p - (\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + ...) = p\\]

On the other hand, the value inside the parenthesis is equal to 1, so the value of p will also be equal to one.
