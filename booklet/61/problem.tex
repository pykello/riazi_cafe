\begin{problem}{61/figs/61_pic.jpeg}{Cake Cutting} Ten people want to divide a cake among themselves. Each person likes some parts of the cake and dislikes other parts. The goal is to divide the cake with 9 knife cuts in a way that each person gets at least one-tenth of the parts they like. How should we cut the cake?
