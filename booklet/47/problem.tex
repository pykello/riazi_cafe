\begin{problem}{47/figs/47_pic.png}{Division of a Rectangle into Squares} We have a $6 \times 13$ rectangle. Each time, we can cut it horizontally or vertically and break it into two smaller rectangles with integer edge lengths. We can then repeat the same process with each of the smaller rectangles. We continue on until all of the rectangles are squares. How many cuts do we need to achieve this goal?\\[0.2cm]
	
\textbf{Question 2}: What if the dimensions of the original rectangle is $9 \times 10$?\end{problem}
