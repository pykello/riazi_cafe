\begin{problem}{18/figs/18_ant.jpg}{Ants on a Piece of Wood} There is a piece of wood of length 1 meter which is horizontally placed on a tree. 50 ants are located on random positions of the wood. Each ant is either directed to the right or the left with equal probabilities. Each ant starts moving at a speed of 1 meter per hour and falls down the tree when it reaches the end of the wood. If two ants intersect, both of their direction will be reversed and they both keep moving in the opposite directions with the same speed.

How long does it take on average for the last ant to fall? We assume for simplicity that the size of each ant is negligible and their locations and their directions are realized independently. \\[0.2cm]
