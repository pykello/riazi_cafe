\begin{problem}{32/figs/32_ninja.png}{Heshmat and Gholi}
This  is a modified version of one of the IMO 2023 problems.\\[0.2cm]

We have 1369 lines of balls; In each line $i$, there are $i$ balls placed next to each other. The $j$'th ball of each line is connected to the $j$'th and $j+1$'th balls of the next row. A ninja path consists of 1369 balls from different lines, where balls of consecutive lines are connected (see an example in the figure).

Heshmat selects one ball from each line and colors them with red. Afterwards, Gholi finds a ninja path that contains the most number of red balls. If Heshmat does not cooperate with Gholi, what is the minimum number of red balls of Gholi's ninja path?\\[0.2cm]
