\begin{problem}{73/figs/73_pic.jpg}{Ayla and Bardia} Ayla has 100 distinct real numbers $x_1$ to $x_{100}$. Bardia is not aware of this sequence and his goal is to find the index of the smallest number by asking some questions. For each question, Bardia chooses two numbers $i$ and $j$ between 1 and 100 and asks Ayla "Which number is smaller, $x_i$ or $x_j?$". Ayla is allowed to answer one of Bardia's questions incorrectly but all the other answers should be correct. What is the smallest number of questions that Bardia has to ask in order to find the smallest number given Ayla may answer one question incorrectly?\\[0.2cm]
