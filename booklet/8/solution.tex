\begin{solution}.
The first player has a winning strategy. \\[0.2cm]
Let us paint the pieces of the chocolate in the following way: Starting from the first piece, we paint every other piece with white. We then paint the rest of the pieces with black. Thus, the first piece of the chocolate will be white and the last piece will be black. The first person can choose a color and always eat pieces with that color. If he plays so, the second player is limited to only eating pieces from the other color.  Notice that the total number of pistachios is odd, and therefore the total number of pistachios on black and white pieces cannot be equal. Thus, one color has more pistachios than the other color and the first player can win the game by always eating pieces of that color.\\[0.2cm]
