\begin{problem}{8/figs/08_chocolate.jpg}{Chocolate}We have a chocolate with 1000 pieces and 10001 pistachios on it. Each pistachio is placed on one piece and any number of pistachios can be placed on each piece. Two people play a game in turns. Each time one of them chooses a piece from the top or the bottom of the chocolate and eats it. The game continues until the chocolate is finished and whoever eats the most pistachios wins the game.
