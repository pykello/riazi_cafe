\begin{problem}{27/figs/27_magic_boxes.png}{Magic Boxes}
	You are given 1000 coins to put in two magic boxes. You can divide the coins between these two boxes. After closing the boxes, we throw a coin for each box.
If the coin of the first box is drown head, the number of coins in the box will be doubled. If it is tail, it will be halved. (we allow for non-integer numbers if the original number is odd)
For the second box, if the coin is drawn head, the number of coins in the box will be multiplied by 1.5. If it is a head, the number of coins will  not change.
At the end, any number of coins left in each box will be yours. How would  you play this game?
If instead of two different coins, we use the same coin for both boxes (with similar rules) how do you play?\\[0.2cm]
