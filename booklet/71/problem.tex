\begin{problem}{71/figs/71_pic.jpg}{Playing with Random Numbers} Mojgan plays this game: She has a number $X$, which is initially zero. At each step, she has two options: either to end the game with the current value of $X$, or to add a uniformly random number between zero and one to $X$. If $X$ becomes greater than one, the game also ends.
	If $X$ is less than one when the game ends, Mojgan gets a final score of $X$. Otherwise, she gets a final score of zero.\\[0.2cm]
	
	Mojgan's goal is to play in such a way that the expected value of her final score is maximized. What is the optimal strategy for Mojgan to maximize her score in the end?
