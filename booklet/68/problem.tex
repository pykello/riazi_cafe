\begin{problem}{68/figs/68_pic.jpg}{Mouse and Cat} Consider a circle with a radius of one meter. A mouse is placed at the center of the circle, and a cat is positioned somewhere on the circumference of the circle. The mouse can move freely within the circle, while the cat can only move along the circle's border. The mouse's goal is to escape the circle, and the cat's goal is to catch the mouse (by moving along the circle's border).
Once the mouse gets out of the circle, he can run infinitely faster than the cat so all it takes for the mouse to escape the circle is to cross the border without getting caught by the cat.\\[0.2cm]

Assuming both move with constant speeds, what is the smallest ratio of the speed of the cat over the speed of the mouse which enables the cat to always prevent the mouse from escaping?
