\begin{problem}{65/figs/65_pic.png}{Tiling the $10 \times 10$ Grid} We have a  $10 \times 10$ grid and we want to place a number of $1 \times 5$ and $5 \times 1$ tiles on it so that no two tiles overlap.
	
	What is the minimum number of tiles that can be placed so that there is no room for another tile?
