\begin{problem}{15/figs/15_coins2.jpg}{Finding the Broken Machine}We have ten coin maker machines each of which produces 10 gram coins. One of the machines is broken and instead of 10 gram coins, it produces 9 gram coins. We have a digital scale and we want to find the broken machine by using it only once. At least how many coins should we produce for this purpose? What if we could use the scale twice? \\[0.2cm]

Each time we use the scale, we can weigh any combination of coins produced by different machines. Each machine can make as many coins for us as desired. For example, we can put 10 coins from the first machine, 12 coins from the second machine, 1000 coins from the third machine, and so on. We can then put them on the scale and calculate the total weight of all coins produced.\\[0.2cm]
