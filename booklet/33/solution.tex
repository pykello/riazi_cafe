\begin{solution}
If we take the square roots of both sides, we have:

$$
\sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + ...}}}} = 25.
$$

The above expression is equivalent to the part under the sequare root  of the original expression. Thus, we can replace it with $25$ to get the following equation:

$$
x + 25 = 625
$$

Which implies $x = 600$.
