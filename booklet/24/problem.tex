\begin{problem}{24/figs/24_dices.jpg}{Boxes and Dice}We have 6 boxes numbered from 1 to 6. Each box has a label on it originally equal to 1 for all boxes (notice that the numbers and labels are two separate concepts). Each time, we roll two dice. Let the number of the first die be $x$ and the number of the second die be $y$. We change the label of box $x$ to $y$.

On average, how many times do we need to repeat this until the labels of the boxes are equal to their numbers?\\[0.2cm]

\textbf{Supplementary question}: on average, how many times do we repeat this process until the labels of all 6 boxes are distinct?\\[0.2cm]
