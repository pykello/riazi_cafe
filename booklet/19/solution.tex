The answer is negative.\\[0.2cm]

If such an ordering existed, then for every pair $i$ and $i+1$, the parity of the positions of $i$ and $j$ in the permutation would be the same. Thus either all numbers would be placed on odd positions or all numbers would be placed on even positions; Neither of which is  possible.
