\begin{solution}
According to the table below, because the 12345th symmetric number is placed between the 10999th and 19999th symmetric number, it is known that the 1346th symmetric number is 8 digits.


| The index of the first number | Digits The number of states
|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 1 9 |
| 10 | 2 | 9 |
| 19 | 3 9*10
| 109 | 4 | 9*10
| 1999 | 5 | 9*100
| 1099 | 6 | 9*100
| 1999 | 7 | 9*1000
| 10999 | 8 | 9*1000
| 1999 | 9 | 9*10000 |


Since the left side of the first symmetrical 8-digit number is equal to 1000, 1346 is sufficient
Add to it to find the 1346th symmetrical 8-digit number, which is 23466432.
