\begin{problem}{/images/problems/09_boys_and_girls.jpg}{Girls and Boys} 
    In a village, every child is born a girl with probability $0.5$ and is born a boy with probability $0.5$. In this village, every family keeps giving birth to children until the last child is a girl. What will be the ratio of the population of girls and boys in this village?\\[0.2cm]

\begin{solution}.
The ratio of girls and boys will be equal.\\[0.2cm]

With this strategy, the number of girls in each family will be exactly 1. The number of boys is equal to:

\begin{itemize}
\item zero with a probability of 1/2,
\item one with a probability of 1/4,
\item two with a probability of 1/8,
\item and in general $i$ with probability $2^{-i-1}$.
\end{itemize}

Let us denote this value by $p$. Therefore we have $p = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} 2^{-i-1}$ and thus  $$2p - (\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + ...) = p.$$
Notice that the value inside the parenthesis is equal to 1, and therefore the value of $p$ will also be equal to 1.\\[0.2cm]
