\begin{problem}{/images/problems/19_permutation.jpg}{Oddly Spaced Numbers}
    Can we a write the numbers 1 to 9 in a line from left to right  so that between each number $i$ and $i+1$ (i.e.., between 1 and 2, between 2 and 3, $\ldots$, and between 8 and 9) there is an odd number of numbers? If yes, how? If not why?\\[0.2cm]

``The number of numbers between $a$ and $b$" includes neither $a$ nor $b$. For example, in $\langle 1,3,5,2,4,8,9,6,7 \rangle$ there is one number between 4 and 5, and there are two numbers between 1 and 2.\\[0.2cm]

\begin{solution}.
The answer is negative.\\[0.2cm]

If such an ordering existed, then for every pair $i$ and $i+1$, the parity of the positions of $i$ and $j$ in the permutation would be the same. Thus either all numbers would be placed on odd positions or all numbers would be placed on even positions; Neither of which is  possible.
