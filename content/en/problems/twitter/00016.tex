\begin{solution}.
The correct answer is approximately equal to 18.7368.\\[0.2cm]

For simplicity we rotate the image by 45 degrees. Then, using the relationship of the two circles, we define $(x,y)$ as the intersection of the small circle and one of the quarter circles and compute it. Using that, we determine the angles $\alpha \simeq 0.9733$ and $\beta \simeq 2.4188$ defined in the figure below:

\end{center}

We then compute the following quantities:
\begin{itemize}
\item The area of the green plus orange parts using $\beta$ and the radius of the smaller circle ($\simeq 14.0593$).
\item The area of the orange part using $\alpha$ and the radius of the quarter circle ($\simeq 4.6909$).
\end{itemize}
Finally, by the latter quantity from the former one, we get the area of each of the green parts ($\simeq 4.6909$). Since we have 2 of these greens parts in the figure, we multiply the answer by 2 to obtain $\simeq 18.7368$.
