\begin{problem}{/images/problems/21_egg.jpg}{Throwing Eggs}

We have a 101-story building and three eggs. We know that if we throw an egg from the 101st floor, it will break, but we want to find the lowest floor for which if we throw an egg from there, it will break. Every time we can throw an egg from a  floor $n$ and see if it breaks? If it breaks, we realize that the answer is less than or equal to $n$, but one of the eggs is lost. If it doesn't break, we will found out that the answer is more than $n$, however, we can reuse that egg for future experiments. How many throws do we need in the worst case?
