\begin{problem}{/images/problems/34_stock.png}{IPO}You are going to participate in the purchase of the initial shares of a company. We know that the stock value of the company is a random variable drawn from the uniform distribution $[0,1000]$. Although you are not aware of the value at the IPO, you do have the knowledge of the distribution. You offer a bid $x$ to the owner of the company. If the value of the company's shares at the IPO is less than $x$, you would buy that company's shares at a value of $x$ dollars, otherwise you wouldn't buy anything.

You know that the value of the company's stock will increase by $50$ percent after your purchase. What proposal would you make to the owner of the company?\\[0.2cm]

\begin{solution}
Your best move is to propose a bid of $0$ to the owner (which does not load to a purchase).\\[0.2cm]
	
Suppose you offer a bid of $x$ to buy the company's share. Then the probability that you will buy the stock is $x/1000$ (probability that the stock value is  less than $x$). Also, in this case, the average share value is equal to $x/2$, which after a $50\%$ increase will be equal to $0.75x$, which is still less than the amount of money paid. Thus, the it is best if you make a bid of $x=0$.
