	Find the value of x in the following expression: $$ x + \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \ldots}}} = 625. $$\\[0.2cm] Link to the problem on Twitter: \url{https://twitter.com/Riazi_Cafe/status/1699714621899481219}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
If we take the square roots of both sides, we have:

$$
\sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + ...}}}} = 25.
$$

The above expression is equivalent to the part under the sequare root  of the original expression. Thus, we can replace it with $25$ to get the following equation:

$$
x + 25 = 625
$$

Which implies $x = 600$.
