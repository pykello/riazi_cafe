## Setting up the environment

You have two options here:

* Use the Ruby provided by your package manager, e.g. 'sudo apt update && sudo apt install ruby' on Ubuntu.
* Use asdf-vm which allows to use directory specific environments. See [README-asdf.md]

To install Ruby dependencies: `bundle update`
